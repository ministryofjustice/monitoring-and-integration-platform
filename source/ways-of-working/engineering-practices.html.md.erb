# Engineering Practices

| Title         | Notes         |
|---------------|---------------|
| Development environment as standard | We always have a development environment for things that run in Production. Core spoke/workload |
| Follow best practice for resource naming | Resource name should follow naming convention i.e. resource name then unique identifier. |
| Terraform is used to define our infrastructure | |
| Data kept within UK | For instance in Azure we are talking about UK south/UK West regions |
| Cloud resources must be appropriately tagged | We will adhere to tagging standards adopted by MOJ for each different Cloud |
| Tenant Segregation | 	Strong separation between operating environments (production, pre-production, and development). |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Code will be stored within MoJâ€™s GitHub Enterprise repositories and deployment will be via pipelines |
| All resource changes to any environment actioned via code | Changes to environments always actioned via CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deploymen) |
| Every commit must have a commit message | Clear descriptions of the change being commited |
| Repository branches should have a sensible name that relates to their purpose | Separated using "-" |
| Pull Requests have comments and descriptions | Clear descriptions on all Pull Requests and comments |
| Source control for all code | No code left in the developer workstations |
| Incorporate security early in the development lifecycle | We need to incorporate security into all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment. This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities from being introduced into the software.|
