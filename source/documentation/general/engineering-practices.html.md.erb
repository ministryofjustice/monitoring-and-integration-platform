# Engineering Practices

| Title         | Notes         |
|---------------|---------------|
| Development environment as standard | We always have a development environment for things that run in Production. Core spoke/workload |
| Follow best practice for resource naming | Resource name should follow naming convention i.e. resource name then unique identifier. |
| Infrastructure as Code (IaC) | Code will be stored within MoJâ€™s GitHub Enterprise repositories and deployment will be via pipelines |
| All resource changes to any environment actioned via code | Changes to environments always actioned via CI/CD (continuous integration and continuous delivery/continuous deploymen) |
| Committs have comments | Clear descriptions of the change being committed |
| Pull Requests have comments and descriptions | Clear descriptions on all Pull Requests and comments |
| Incorporate security early in the development lifecycle | We need to incorporate security into all aspects of the software development lifecycle, from design to deployment. This helps to prevent security vulnerabilities from being introduced into the software.|
| Foster a culture of collaboration and blameless communication | Blameless communication is important, as it encourages team members to learn from mistakes and identify areas for improvement. We need to be able to communicate effectively and collaborate internally and externally on all aspects of the software development lifecycle. |
