Juniper Mist
====================

After completing the investigation of the possible options of ingesting juniper AP45 logs we concluded that the easiest approach to ingest their data was through HTTP Custom Connector in XSIAM.  

Step By Step Implementations
---------------------

Login to XSIAM and Navigate to “Settings” > ”Data Sources”  
![image-1-mist](/images/onboarding/mist/1.png)

Click on “Add Data Source” 
![image-2-mist](/images/onboarding/mist/2.png)

Search for “Custom - HTTP based Collector” and click on the “Connect” button available by hovering over it.  
![image-3-mist](/images/onboarding/mist/3.png)

Fill the relevant information as 
- Name: LAN Juniper MIST 
- Compression: uncompressed 
- Log Format: JSON 
- Vendor: juniper 
- Juniper: mist 
 and then click on “Save & Generate Token”  
![image-4-mist](/images/onboarding/mist/4.png)

NOTE: The action will generate a token, this must be saved in the Azure Key Vault straight away as it will be not possible to access it again.

Create the parsing rule 
-------------------------
Parsing rules can be defined by navigating to Settings > Data Sources and then selecting Parsing Rules 
![image-5-mist](/images/onboarding/mist/5.png)

The new rule can be defined in the User Defined tab by appending the following code snippet: 
    [INGEST:vendor="juniper", product="mist", target_dataset="juniper_mist_raw", no_hit=keep] 

    filter topic != "audits" 
    | alter data_array = events -> [0]{} 
    | alter ap = data_array -> ap 
    | alter ap_name = data_array -> ap_name 
    | alter band = data_array -> band 
    | alter bssid = data_array -> bssid 
    | alter client_ip = data_array -> client_ip 
    | alter connect = data_array -> connect 
    | alter connect_float = data_array -> connect_float 
    | alter mac = data_array -> mac 
    | alter org_id = data_array -> org_id 
    | alter random_mac = data_array -> random_mac 
    | alter rssi = data_array -> rssi 
    | alter site_id = data_array -> site_id 
    | alter site_name = data_array -> site_name 
    | alter ssid = data_array -> ssid 
    | alter timestamp = data_array -> timestamp 
    | alter version = data_array -> version 
    | alter wlan_id = data_array -> wlan_id 
    | alter client_family = data_array -> client_family 
    | alter client_manufacture = data_array -> client_manufacture 
    | alter client_model = data_array -> client_model 
    | alter client_os = data_array -> client_os 
    | alter disconnect = data_array -> disconnect 
    | alter disconnect_float = data_array -> disconnect_float 
    | alter duration = data_array -> duration 
    | alter next_ap = data_array -> next_ap 
    | alter termination_reason = data_array -> termination_reason; 

Once done click on *Save*


Juniper MIST Configuration
--------------------------

The configuration in Juniper MIST is carried out by the LAN team. 
What we need to communicate to them is the  *HTTP Endoint* that for live is always https://api-justiceuk.xdr.uk.paloaltonetworks.com/logs/v1/event 
and the *Authorization Key*: by granting access to the vault secret  

The client will have to perform a post call using the following headers: 
    Authorization: {api_key}' -H 'Content-Type: text/plain'
