Juniper Mist LAN
====================

After completing the investigation of the possible options of ingesting juniper AP45 logs we concluded that the easiest approach to ingest their data was through HTTP Custom Connector in XSIAM.

Step By Step Implementation
---------------------

Login to XSIAM and Navigate to *Settings* and go to *Data Sources*
