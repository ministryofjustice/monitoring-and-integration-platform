# What is Cortex XSIAM?
[The Cortex XSIAM](https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cortex/cortex-xsiam) is MOJ's strategic choice of tooling for Security Operation Centre. The Cortext XSIAM is a SAAS solution provided to MOJ by Palo Alto Networks.

The MIP team in collaboration with the SOC team is currently working on:

 - Configuring the XSIAM according to MOJ's requirements
 - Managing access to the platform via SSO with our MOJO Azure AD credentials
 - Managing log ingestions from all MOJ critical services
 - Managing analysis of the ingested data and anomaly detections using correlation rules
 - Managing automatic remediations of incidents using playbooks of [the Cortext XSOAR](https://www.paloaltonetworks.co.uk/cortex/cortex-xsoar)
