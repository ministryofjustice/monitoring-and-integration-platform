# Broker VM infrastructure in Production AWS

Production AWS has a connectivity with MOJ's production network. Atos managed RAS Gateways, that are responsible for Cisco AnyConnect VPN connections, are only able to send syslogs
through our Corsham DataCentres over the Production network. And those devices are only capable to ship syslogs using UDP protocol over port 514 due to a lack of PKI.

Therefore, in order to collect syslogs from those Atos managed Cisco ASA devices, we needed to deploy a cluster of the Cortex Broker VMs in the Production AWS space.

Below is the low level diagram of the [Cortex Broker VM](cortex-broker-vm.html) infrastructure in Production AWS:

>  - **internet-facing network load balancer**

> **Currently supported ports and protocols:**

> - Protocol: UDP
> - Port: 514

### Deployment

This architecture is deployed as a temporary setup. Our plan is to enable internet-facing network load balancer in NOC AWS Infrastructure and then we will decommission this infra.

It essentially involves:

 - Creation of a new security group `xsiam-broker-vm-production` that allows:
  - TCP traffic on port 4443
  - UDP traffic on port 514
 - Creation of three new ec2 instances of type `t2.medium` and attach them to private subnets
 - Creation of a new target group with these new ec2 instances
 - Associate this new target group to new internal network load balancer

> **Important!**
>
> These ec2 instances require a custom AMI
>
> We followed Cortex Admin Guide: [Create a Broker VM Amazon Machine Image (AMI)](https://docs-cortex.paloaltonetworks.com/r/Cortex-XDR/Cortex-XDR-Pro-Administrator-Guide/Create-a-Broker-VM-Amazon-Machine-Image-AMI)
> to create a custom AMI and provided the AMI id in terraform to create the ec2 instances.

Once the ec2 instances are up and running, we used a jump-box that is provided by the NOC team to access each ec2 instances and carried out the following:

 - [Initial Setup](./#initial-setup)
 - [Register the Broker VM](./#register-the-broker-vm)
 - Add the Broker VM to the cluster
  - We created a new Broker cluster in XSIAM called `Production AWS` and we added both brokers in that cluster
