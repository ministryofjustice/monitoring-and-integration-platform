# XSIAM SSO Configuration
MOJO Cortex XSIAM has been integrated with SSO using MOJO Azure AD. A new enterprise application has been created in Azure for SAML based SSO and on the XSIAM side, SSO authentication
has been enabled.

> **Important!**
>
> SSO is now the preferred method of accessing the XSIAM

Due to this SSO configuration; authentication now takes place in Azure AD and authorisation takes place in XSIAM. Therefore, in order to provide someone access to XSIAM with some specific
permissions, below is what we will need to do:

### Create authentication:

 - **Step 1** - Create a `Security Group` in Azure AD.
 - **Step 2** - Add users in this group as members.
 - **Step 3** - Go to the SSO Enterprise app and assign this new group.
 - **Step 4** - Take a note of the `Object id` of this new group for the next stage.

### Create authorisation:

 - **Step 5** - Create a user group in XSIAM with the same name as the `Security Group` above.
 - **Step 6** - Add the `Object id` of the `Security Group` in the `SAML Group Mapping` section.
 - **Step 7** - Select appropriate `Role` in the Role selector for this user group.

These above steps should create the neccessary access for the new user.

Below is a list current Azure AD groups and their Role mappings:
