# Cortex Broker VM

The Palo Alto Networks Broker is a secured virtual machine (VM), integrated with Cortex XSIAM, that bridges our corporate network and Cortex XSIAM. By setting up the broker,
we establish a secure connection in which we can route our endpoints, and collect and forward logs and files for analysis.

The Broker can be leveraged for running different services separately on the VM using the same Palo Alto Networks authentication. Once installed, the Broker VM automatically
receives updates and enhancements from Cortex XSIAM, providing new capabilities without having to install a new VM.
