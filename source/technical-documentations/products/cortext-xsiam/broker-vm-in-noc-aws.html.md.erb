# Cortex Broker VM infrastructure in NOC AWS Space
NOC AWS has a connectivity with Mgmt Network of MoJ remote offices. All core networking devices are interconnectect via the Mgmt
Network and those devices are only capable to ship syslogs ver the Mgmt Network using UDP protocol over port 514.

Therefore, in order to collect syslogs from the core networking devices in various remote MoJ offices, we needed to deploy a cluster of the Cortex Broker VMs in the NOC AWS space.

> **Note:**
>
> Broker VM ec2 instances are behind an **internal network load balancer**
>
> and the IP addresses for the load balancer are: `172.27.3.50` and `172.27.4.50`
