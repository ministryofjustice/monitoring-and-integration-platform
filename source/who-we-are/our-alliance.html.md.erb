- We agree that itâ€™s ok to disagree and challenge opinions.
- We learn from each other and ask lots of questions.
- We are respectful of others time.
- We commit to continual learning and development.
- We actively encourage feedback and thoughts on our work.
- We have fun.
- We foster a culture of collaboration and blameless communication
